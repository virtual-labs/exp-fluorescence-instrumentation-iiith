#### Pre-Assignments :

1. Why do we need a radiation source of high optical power (that is, a large number of photons per unit time) in spectrofluorimeter?  
2. Why do we use xenon arc lamp as source in spectrofluorimeter?  
3. Why is a detector more powerful preferred in spectrofluorimeter than that in spectrophotometer?  
4. Fluorescence spectra can be presented on either a wavelength scale or a wavenumber scale. Which scale is linear in energy?  
5. What are the advantages and the disadvantages of using a laser instead of a lamp as an excitation source?  
6.  All emission measurements must start far enough above the excitation wavelength. Why? (Hint. Near the excitation wavelength, reflectance, refraction and scattering are high.)  

#### Post-Assignments :

1. A quartz cuvette with all sides transparent are used in spectrofluorimetric measurements, unlike the ones for UV-visible spectrophotometric measurements where two opposite sides are transparent. Why?  
2. Why is the front face or right angle collection geometry used in fluorescence spectroscopy instead of 180<sup>o</sup> collection geometry that is used in UV-visible absorption spectroscopy?  
3. What collection geometry was used in the present experiment?  
4. What happens to the emission spectrum when the chosen excitation wavelength lies far away from the actual maximum excitation wavelength?  
5. "One has to be sure that the solvent blank does not fluoresce in the wavelength range of interest." Why?
